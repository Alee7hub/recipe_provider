## Instructions

You are assisting in the design and implementation of the first phase of a food recipe recommendation app. The app helps users find recipes based on the ingredients they already have. Users should be able to input their available ingredients in three different ways:

* Typing a text list

* Uploading images of their fridge or pantry

* Using voice input to describe what they have

Additionally, users must be able to select their preferred cuisine style (e.g., Italian, Greek, Persian, etc.) through a separate, dedicated menu.

The first phase of this project focuses entirely on the frontend/UI, not the backend. The following requirements must be met:

1. The user interface must be visually appealing and appetizing, creating an inviting experience for visitors.

2. The landing page must be clean and minimal, displaying only:

    * The multi-modal ingredient input field (text, image, or voice)

    * The cuisine style preference selector

Once the user provides inputs, these will be sent to the backend (not in scope here), and the app must display the processed output (recipe suggestions).

Do not implement or assume any backend logic in this phase.
